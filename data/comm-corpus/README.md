# The *comm-corpus*

This is the initial default corpus, given as an example so you don't have to create a "data/something" to start using this product.
You'll need the environment variable `CORPUS_NAME` with the value **comm-corpus** for all this stuff to work.

Read the main `README.md` file, in the `.env` file section. Use that default and you'll be fine using the *comm-corpus*.
